#  D’RAP – Analog Stomp box Guitar Effect Pedals

**D’RAP** is a set of fully analog guitar effect pedals—**Wah**, **Distortion**, and **Phaser**—designed to shape and enhance electric guitar tones using carefully engineered analog circuitry. Each pedal uses operational amplifiers, filters, and passive components to deliver distinct tonal characteristics with low noise and high reliability. Housed in compact enclosures and equipped with true-bypass switching, these pedals are optimized for both live and studio performance.

This project was developed as part of the EN2091 Laboratory Practice and Projects module in Semester 3.

## 🎸 Pedal Overview

### Wah Pedal
Simulates the iconic “wah-wah” tone by sweeping frequency bands with a resonant filter circuit controlled by a potentiometer.

- Vocal-like tonal shifts ideal for expressive solos  
- Built using op-amps and active filter stages  

###  Distortion Pedal
Adds harmonic richness and sustain by clipping the guitar signal through a dual-stage op-amp and diode-based circuit.

- High-gain saturation suited for rock and metal  
- Adjustable tone and distortion levels

###  Phaser Pedal
Creates a swirling, spacey effect by phase-shifting the signal across several frequency bands using all-pass filters and modulation.

- Adds depth and motion to clean tones  
- Analog low-frequency oscillator (LFO) driven
